    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>I'm Bolametiren "Bibi" Akinlaja, a Data Analytics Program Manager, Program Builder, and Innovation Strategist with professional experience spanning Nigeria and the United States. My work centers on designing data-driven programs, communities, and systems that expand workforce pipelines, support research, and help institutions turn analytics into meaningful, real-world impact.</p>
    
    <p>Rather than focusing solely on data outputs, my career has been shaped by building the infrastructure around data—the programs, partnerships, and learning environments that allow data to be understood, applied, and sustained.</p>

    <h2>Building Programs and Systems That Scale</h2>
    
    <p>At Bowie State University's Center for Data Analytics (CDA), I lead initiatives across program design, project execution, research support, and industry engagement. My responsibilities span strategy and operations: shaping program models, managing timelines and resources, coordinating cross-functional teams, and ensuring outcomes are measurable and repeatable.</p>
    
    <p>Over time, my role evolved from project coordination into program leadership, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Managing multi-phase analytics and workforce initiatives from concept to delivery</li>
      <li>Overseeing operations and modernization efforts within the Truist Data Analytics Research, Trading, and Technology (DARTT) Lab</li>
      <li>Designing and delivering analytics training programs that build practical skills in data analysis, modeling, and visualization</li>
      <li>Supporting faculty and student research through applied analytics, reporting, and data storytelling</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I have also served as an assistant facilitator for an NSF-funded workshop on Data and the African Diaspora, contributing to national conversations around culturally relevant data science education and inclusive research practices.</p>

    <h2>Founding the Data Tribe: Building a Culture of Data</h2>
    
    <p>A defining milestone in my work has been the creation and founding of the <span class="emphasis">Data Tribe</span>, a student-centered data community housed within the Center for Data Analytics. I founded the Data Tribe to address a gap I consistently observed: students had access to tools and courses, but lacked a sense of belonging, continuity, and community around data.</p>
    
    <p>From concept to execution, I:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Designed the vision, structure, and operating model for the Data Tribe</li>
      <li>Built its brand identity, recruitment strategy, and engagement framework</li>
      <li>Created peer-led programming that blends technical learning, storytelling, and professional development</li>
      <li>Integrated industry conversations, mentorship, and experiential learning into the community</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Under my leadership, the Data Tribe grew into a student-owned leadership engine that:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Engaged 250+ participants across workshops, panels, and community events</li>
      <li>Supported workforce readiness through industry engagements, including conversations with partners such as Northrop Grumman</li>
      <li>Created a welcoming entry point into analytics for students across majors and skill levels</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="pull-quote">
      The Data Tribe reflects my belief that data education is strongest when it is communal, human-centered, and accessible—not isolated to classrooms or labs.
    </div>

    <h2>Leadership Through Mentorship and Engagement</h2>
    
    <p>Beyond formal programs, I've focused on pipeline building—creating pathways that connect learners to mentors, applied projects, and professional networks. This work includes designing mentorship models, facilitating student leadership development, and creating experiences that allow participants to practice skills in real contexts.</p>
    
    <p>Earlier in my career, I served as President of the International Business Club, where I led globally focused programming including cultural exchange events, guest speaker sessions, and mentorship initiatives. These experiences reinforced my approach to leadership: learning thrives when it is experiential, relational, and globally informed.</p>

    <h2>A Global Foundation in Strategy and Execution</h2>
    
    <p>Before transitioning to the United States, I worked as a Project Manager in Nigeria within the hospitality sector. In that role, I led market research, business planning, digital optimization, and cross-functional execution—often working with limited resources and tight timelines.</p>
    
    <p>This experience grounded me in practical execution and adaptability, shaping how I approach program design today: prioritizing clarity, flexibility, and outcomes that matter to stakeholders.</p>

    <h2>Expanding Into AI and Strategic Decision-Making</h2>
    
    <p>To strengthen my ability to align analytics with leadership and organizational strategy, I am currently completing a Certificate in AI Business Strategy from Johns Hopkins University. This program is expanding my understanding of:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Responsible and ethical AI adoption</li>
      <li>AI governance and decision-making frameworks</li>
      <li>Translating analytics into executive-level strategy</li>
      <li>Aligning technology investments with mission-driven outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This step represents a shift toward data-informed leadership, ensuring that emerging technologies are implemented thoughtfully and sustainably.</p>

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    
    <p>Across roles and contexts, my approach is defined by:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> designing programs that connect people, tools, and processes</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> translating complexity into structures others can follow</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> working across disciplines and institutions</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> prioritizing outcomes that can be measured, communicated, and scaled</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Core Areas of Focus</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Program & Project Management</li>
      <li>Data Analytics & Visualization</li>
      <li>Workforce & Talent Pipeline Development</li>

      <li>Research Support & Applied Analytics</li>
